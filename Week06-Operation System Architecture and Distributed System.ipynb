    "Explore the architecture of a kernel suitable for a distributed system.\n",
    "\n",
    "A key principle of DS is openness and with this in mind let us examine the major kernel architecture:\n",
    "* Monolithic kernels\n",
    "* Layered architecture-based kernels\n",
    "* Micro-kernels\n",
    "\n",
    "# Open DS and System Software\n",
    "\n",
    "A open DS should make it possible to:\n",
    "* Run only the system software which is necessary for its particular role in the system architecture at each computer. For example, system software needs of laptops and dedicated servers(strong security) are different and loading redundant modules wastes memory resources\n",
    "* Allow the software implementing any particular service to be changed independent of other facilities. That is you can dynamically add or remove mouse driver.\n",
    "* Allow for alternatives of the same service to be provided, when this is required to suit different users or applications. Different modules can be plugged in dynamically.\n",
    "* Introduce new services without harming existing system's integrity.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Separating Mechanisms and Policies in OS and DS\n",
    "\n",
    "A guiding principle of OS design: The separation of fixed resource management \"mechanisms\" from resource management \"policies\" which vary from application to application and service to service.(university and bank will have different policies)\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Mechanisms\" will always be the same while \"policies\" can be different for different system. Maybe up to this period, people can only do this much, in the next period, user can do more. Policy keep changing.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, an ideal scheduling system would provide mechanisms that enable a multimedia application such as video conferencing to meets its real-time demands while coexisting with a non-real-time application such as web browsing.\n",
    "\n",
    "That is kernel would provide only the most basic mechanisms upon which the general resource management tasks at a node are carried out. Server modules would be dynamically loaded as required, to implement the required RM policies for the currently running applications. If you put policy into kernel, it will become a rigid OS, you have to follow the rule strictly. If you put policy into user space, you can use this OS in mobile, laptop, PC and server. Depending on the devices, you can change the user space.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mechanism enforce policy.\n",

    "# OS/Kernel Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "The two key examples of kernel design approaches are:\n",
    "* Monolithic\n",
    "* Microkernel\n",
    "\n",
    "Basically these two designs differ primarily in the decision as to what functionality belongs in the kernel and what is left to server processes that can be dynamically loaded to run on top of it.\n",
    "\n",
    "In literature, we find predominantly $3$ types of OS:\n",
    "* Monolithic OS\n",
    "* Layered OS\n",
    "* Microkernel-based OS\n",
    "\n",
    "The first two may be put under the same category as monolithic.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"img/img29.png\" width=\"500\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Given printer capability to mobile device can make it slow.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Operating System Models\n",
    "\n",
    "It serves as frameworks that unify capabilities, services and tasks to be performed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Three approaches to build OS:\n",
    "* Monolithic OS\n",
    "* Layered OS\n",
    "* Microkernel based OS(Client Server OS, suitable for distributed systems)\n",
    "\n",
    "Simplicity, flexibility(easily extend new requirements) and high performance are crucial for OS.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Monolithic Operating System\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"img/img30.png\" width=\"500\">\n",
    "\n",
    "It puts pretty everything in kernel. Better application performance but difficult to extend\n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantages:\n",
    "* It is massive, it performs all basic OS functions and takes up in the order of megabytes of code and data\n",
    "* It is undifferentiated: it is coded in non-module way(traditionally), although modern ones are much more layered\n",
    "* It is intractable, altering any individual software component to adapt it to changing requirements is difficult\n",
    "\n",
    "E.g., MS-DOS\n",
    "\n",
    "## Layered OS\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"img/img31.png\" width=\"500\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Upper layer uses services from lower layer, not opposite.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Easier to enhance\n",
    "* Each layer of code access lower level interface\n",
    "* Low-application performance due to multiple layers\n",
    "\n",
    "E.g., UNIX\n",
    "\n",
    "# Micro-kernel\n",
    "\n",
    "The new trend in OS design is to separate mechanisms and policies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Compared to monolithic, microkernel design provides only the most basic abstractions: address space, threads and local IPC(inter process communication). All other system services are provided by servers that are dynamically loaded precisely on those computers in the DS that require them.(different device driver) Clients access these system services using the kernel's message-based invocation mechanisms.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"img/img32.png\" width=\"500\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Different services talk to each other through kernel.\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional services becomes subsystems. And OS is Micro-kernel plus User Subsystems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Microkernel appears as a layer between hardware and a layer of major system components(subsystem). If performance rather than portability is goal, then middleware may use facilities of MK directly(bypass the subsystem). Usually, the microkernel supports middleware via subsystem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Popular Microkernel Systems:\n",
    "* MACH, CMU\n",
    "* ChorusOS (Sun, USA) Realtime OS(RTOS - action has to happen in real time)\n",
    "* QNX - Unix-like RTOS, used in a variety of devices including cars and mobile phones(BlackBerry)\n",
    "* Windows NT\n",
    "\n",
    "# Comparison\n",
    "\n",
    "The main advantages of a MK-based OS:\n",
    "* A relative small kernel is more likely to be free of bugs than one that is larger and complex\n",
    "* Extensibility and its ability to enforce modularity behind memory protection boundaries\n",
    "\n",
    "The advantage of a monolithic OS:\n",
    "* Relative efficiency with which operations can be invoked is high because even invocation to a separate user-level address space on the same node is more costly\n",
    "\n",
    "# Hybrid Approaches\n",
    "\n",
    "Many modern OSs follow hybrid approach in OS structure. E.g., Windows NT\n",
    "\n",
    "Pure microkernel OSs such as Chorus & Mach have changed over time to allow servers to be loaded dynamically into the kernel address space or into a user-level address space.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some OSs use event-based model as a mechanism for interaction between modules grafted into the kernel address space."
