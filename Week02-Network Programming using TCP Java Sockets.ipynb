    "\n",
    "TCP(Transmission Control Protocol) is a **connection-oriented** communication protocol that provides a reliable flow of data between two computers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Analogy: Speaking on phone\n",
    "\n",
    "Example applications:\n",
    "\n",
    "* HTTP, FTP, Telnet\n",
    "* Skype uses TCP for call signaling, and both UDP and TCP for transporting media traffic\n",
    "\n",
    "UDP(User Datagram Protocol) is a connectionless communication protocol that sends independent packets of data, called datagrams, from one computer to another with no guarantees about arrival or order of arrival. Every datagram contains all the details about who I am, where should it go.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to sending multiple emails/letters to friends, each containing part of a message.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Clock server\n",
    "* Ping\n",
    "* Live streaming(event/sports broadcasting)\n",
    "\n",
    "The TCP and UDP protocols use ports to map incoming data to a particular process running on a computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Port is represented by a positive(16-bit) integer value\n",
    "* Some ports have been reserved to support common/well known services:\n",
    "    * ftp 21/tcp\n",
    "    * telnet 23/tcp\n",
    "    * smtp 25/tcp\n",
    "    * login 513/tcp\n",
    "* User-level processes/services generally use port number value >= 1024\n",
    "\n",
    "# Sockets\n",
    "\n",
    "* Sockets provide an interface for programming networks at the transport layer\n",
    "* Network communication using Sockets is very much similar to performing file I/O\n",
    "    * In fact, socket handle is treated like file handles\n",
    "    * The streams used in file I/O operation are also applicable to socket-based I/O\n",
    "* Socket-based communication is programming language independent. - That means, a socket program written in Java language can also communicate to a program written in Java or non-Java socket program\n",
    "\n",
    "A server(program) runs on a specific computer and has a socket that is bound to a specific port. The server waits and listens to the socket for a client to make a connection request.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"img/img02.png\" width=\"400\">\n",
    "\n",
    "If everything goes well, the server accepts the connection. Upon acceptance, the server gets a new socket bounds to a different port. It needs a new socket(consequently a different port number) so that it can continue to listen to the original socket for connection requests while serving the connected client.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"img/img03.png\" width=\"400\">\n",
    "\n",
    "* A socket is an endpoint of a two-way communication link between two programs running on the network\n",
    "* A socket is bound to a port number so that the TCP layer can identify the application that data destined to be sent\n",
    "* Java's `.net` package provides two classes:\n",
    "    * Socket - for implementing a client\n",
    "    * ServerSocket - for implementing a server\n",

    "```\n",
    "is = new DataInputStream(client.getInputStream());\n",
    "os = new DataOutputStream(client.getOutputStream());\n",
    "```\n",
    "4. Perform communication with client\n",
    "```\n",
    "Receive from client: String line = is.readLine();\n",
    "Send to client: os.writeBytes(\"Hello\\n\");\n",
    "```\n",
    "5. Close sockets\n",
    "```\n",
    "client.close();\n",
    "```\n",

    "For multi-threaded server:\n",
    "```\n",
    "while(true) {\n",
    "    wait for client request(step 2 above)\n",
