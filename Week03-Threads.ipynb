    "# Middleware\n",
    "\n",
    "Middleware is a layer of software between Applications and Operating System(OS) which powering the nodes of a distributed system. It brings many independent computers together. If we want to run our applications across multiple PCs, then we need middleware.\n",
    "\n",
    "The OS facilitates:\n",
    "* Encapsulation and protection of resources inside servers\n",
    "* Invocation of mechanisms required to access those resources including concurrent access/processing\n",
    "\n",
    "## Network Operating System(NOS)\n",
    "\n",
    "Many distributed OS(all computers parts of the system are under its control) have been investigated, but there are none in general/wide use. But NOS are in wide use for various reasons both technical and non-technical.\n",
    "* Users have much invested in their application software; they will not adopt a new OS that will not run their applications.\n",
    "* Users tend to prefer to have a degree of autonomy of their machines.\n",
    "\n",
    "A combination of middleware and NOSs provides an acceptable balance between the requirement of autonomy and network transparency.\n",
    "* NOS allows users to run their favorite word processor.\n",
    "* Middleware enables users to take advantage of services that become available in their distributed systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Building Distributed Systems\n",
    "\n",
    "DOS or NOS are not enough to build a DS. NOS are a good starting point but we need an additional layer to glue all stuff together.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"img/img04.png\" width=\"400\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Middleware are software frameworks, and there are different middleware for different applications. Such as middleware for communication, middleware for cloud computing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Middleware provides high-level features for DS including communication, management and application specific. This is a uniform layer to build DS services. It also provides runtime environment for applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Operating System provides low/medium level features such as process/thread management, local hardware management(CPU, disk, memory), security(users, groups, domain) and basic networking.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"img/img05.png\" width=\"500\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Unix and Windows are two examples of Network Operating System(NOS) which has a networking capability built into them and so can be used to access remote resources using basic services such as rlogin, telnet.\n",
    "\n",
    "The core OS components and functionality is shown below.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"img/img06.png\" width=\"400\">\n",
    "\n",
    "# Threaded Application\n",
    "\n",
    "Operating System level\n",
    "* Multitasking: multiple applications running at once\n",
    "\n",
    "Application level\n",
    "* Multithreading: multiple operations performed at the same time\n",
    "\n",
    "In modern systems, there are multiple applications run concurrently. This means that there are multiple processes on the computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "One application perform many tasks at once. This means that there are multiple threads within a single process. For example, background printing, GUI rendering and application core logic are three threads for a word processor.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"img/img07.png\" width=\"500\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Threads are light-weight processes within a process.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"img/img08.png\" width=\"500\">\n",
    "\n",
    "When you want to copy files from one device to another, writing can be slower than reading. If we put read and write in separate threads, they can do their the operation at their own speed. This is called producer/consumer model. This is why a waiter can server many customers at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thread are used to perform:\n",
    "* Parallelism and concurrent execution of independent tasks/operations\n",
    "* Implementation of reactive user interfaces\n",
    "* Non blocking I/O operations(a program can continue to do data processing while reading a file)\n",
    "* Asynchronous behavior\n",
    "\n",
    "Difference between parallelism and concurrency: For parallelism, the number of activities equals the number of physical cores. For concurrency, the number of physical resources is less than the number of processes, also called virtually parallelism.\n",
    "\n",
    "To sum up:\n",
    "* A thread is a piece of code that runs in concurrent with other threads\n",
    "* Each thread is a statically ordered sequence of instructions\n",
    "* Threads are used to express concurrency on both single and multiprocessors machines\n",
    "\n",
    "# Java Threads\n",
    "\n",
    "Java has built in support for multithreading, synchronization, thread scheduling and inter-thread communication. Java Garbage Collector is a low-priority thread.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two threading mechanisms: Create a class that extends the Thread class or Create a class that implements the Runnable interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "First method:\n",
    "* Create a class by extending Thread class and override run() method\n",
    "```\n",
    "class MyThread extends Thread\n",
    "{\n",
    "    public void run()\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        // thread body of execution\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "* Create a thread\n",
    "```\n",
    "MyThread thread1 = new MyThread();\n",
    "```\n",
    "* Start execution of threads\n",
    "```\n",
    "thread1.start();\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Second method:\n",
    "* Create a class that implements the interface Runnable and override run() method\n",
    "```\n",
    "class MyThread implements Runnable\n",
    "{\n",
    "    public void run()\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        // thread body of execution\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "* Creating object\n",
    "```\n",
    "MyThread myObject = new MyThread();\n",
    "```\n",
    "* Creating Thread Object\n",
    "```\n",
    "Thread thread1 = new Thread(myObject);\n",
    "```\n",
    "* Start execution\n",
    "```\n",
    "thread1.start();\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"img/img09.png\" width=\"400\">\n",
    "\n",
    "## Thread Priority\n",
    "\n",
    "In Java, each thread is assigned priority, which affects the order in which it is scheduled for running. The threads so far had same default priority(NORM_PRIORITY) and they are served using FCFS(first come first serve) policy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Java allows users to change priority:\n",
    "* ThreadName.setPriority(intNumber)\n",
    "    * MIN_PRIORITY = 1\n",
    "    * NORM_PRIORITY = 5\n",
    "    * MAX_PRIORITY = 10\n",
    "\n",
    "The following three common causes can lead to starvation of threads in Java:\n",
    "1. Threads with high priority swallow all CPU time from threads with lower priority.\n",
    "2. Threads are blocked indefinitely waiting to enter a synchronized block, because other threads are constantly allowed access before it.\n",
    "3. Threads waiting on an object (called wait() on it) remain waiting indefinitely because other threads are constantly awakened instead of it.\n",
    "\n",
    "To avoid starvation, there is starvation policy. If a thread hasn't been served for a long time, the system will increase its priority slowly.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Accessing Shared Resources\n",
    "\n",
    "Applications access to shared resources need to be coordinated.\n",
    "* Two person jobs cannot be printed at the same time by a single printer\n",
    "* Simultaneous operations on your bank account\n",
    "* Can the following operation be done at the same time on the same account?\n",
    "    * Deposit()\n",
    "    * Withdraw()\n",
    "    * Enquire()\n",
    "    \n",
    "If one thread tries to read the data and other thread tries to update the same data, it leads to inconsistent state. This can be prevented by synchronizing access to the data. Using \"synchronized\" method:\n",
    "```\n",
    "public synchronized void update()\n",
    "{\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Architecture for Multithread Servers\n",
    "\n",
    "Multithreading enables servers to maximize their throughput, measured as the number of requests processed per second.\n",
    "\n",
    "Architectures:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Worker pool\n",
    "* Thread-per-request\n",
    "* Thread-per-connection\n",
    "* Thread-per-object\n",
    "\n",
    "In worker pool architecture, the server creates a fixed pool of worker threads to process requests. The module \"receipt and queuing\" receives requests from sockets/ports and places them on a shared request queue for retrieval by the workers. It can save time that requires to create a thread. This can be significant when you have many request that are very sharp load such as web request.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"img/img10.png\" width=\"500\">\n",
    "\n",
    "In thread-per-request architecture, IO Thread creates a new worker thread for each request and worker thread destroys itself after serving the request. It is usually used for long-live request such as downloading request.\n",
    "\n",
    "In thread-per-connection, server associates a Thread with each connection and destroys when client closes the connection. Client may make many requests over the connection.\n",
    "\n",
    "In thread-per-object, server associates thread with each object. An IO thread receives request and queues them for workers, but this time there is a per-object-queue. There may be objects for database, service 1 and service 2. And objects may located remotely.\n",
